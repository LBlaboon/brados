Welcome to BRaDOS!

BRaDOS is my personal OS project which I will be working on as I feel like it.
The main purpose of the project is for me to learn about OS developement.

For the most part, this project will do things the way Linux does things, with
changes as I see fit. While I will make every attempt to ensure that the master
git branch only contains compilable code, I make no guarantees. Use of this OS
is entirely at your own risk.
